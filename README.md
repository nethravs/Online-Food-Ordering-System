#  Food Plaza – Online Food Ordering System

##  About the Project
Food Plaza is an online food ordering web application created as part of a Web Technology mini project. The idea behind this project is to make food ordering simple for users and easier to manage for administrators. Instead of ordering food manually, users can browse food items online, add them to a cart, and place orders with just a few clicks.


##  Project Overview
This project focuses on building a simple and organized system for online food ordering. Customers and administrators have separate logins, so each user sees only the features meant for them. Customers can explore available food items and track their orders, while admins manage food details and update order statuses. The role-based approach helps keep the system secure and easy to use.


##  What the System Can Do
- Allows users to sign up and log in securely  
- Provides separate access for admin and customer  
- Displays available food items clearly  
- Lets customers add items to a cart and place orders  
- Enables admins to add, edit, or remove food items  
- Allows admins to update order delivery status  
- Includes profile pages for both admin and customer  


##  Technologies Used
- JSP for creating dynamic web pages  
- Java for backend logic  
- MySQL for storing application data  
- MySQL Connector for database connectivity  
- Eclipse IDE for development  
- XAMPP Server for local hosting  


##  Database Summary
The project uses a MySQL database to store food items, user details, login information, cart contents, and order status. This helps keep the data organized and allows smooth interaction between different parts of the system.


##  Purpose of the Project
- To make online food ordering simple and convenient  
- To reduce manual effort in managing food orders  
- To provide secure access using admin and customer roles  
- To give users a clean and easy-to-use interface  


## Screenshots
The project includes screenshots of the signup page, admin dashboard, food management pages, customer profile, food listing, and order status screens. These screenshots are provided in the uploaded project report to show the overall working of the system.


##  Scope for Improvement
- Adding online payment options  
- Improving the design for mobile devices  
- Showing complete order history  
- Sending notifications for order updates  


##  Final Note
Food Plaza helped us understand how web technologies like JSP and MySQL work together to build a real-world application. The project shows how a simple idea can be converted into a functional system that improves both user experience and management efficiency.
